Asking questions to peers, coach or future colleagues in a way that'll make both you and them happy
The Mission (must have)
If a friend called you stating "I have a problem in my house", would you be able to help? Hard to say, right? Consider this version of the question: "I have a leak in my sink we installed together. I tried replacing a part x but got stuck because of y. I've already tried z, but then heard a breaking noise. Would you be able to help?". Now you have a clear idea if you might be able to help solve it, and where to start. Much better, no? Development is no different!

Read the Stackoverflow guide on how to ask a good question. Discuss how these tips are relevant when asking questions in a team (e.g. during your internship). Feel free to bring up other tips you think of that are not in the article.

The goal is not a summary of this article, but a hands-on guide to ask the perfect question. Your peers, coach and later colleagues will love you for it!

Finally, streamline your rough ideas into a beautiful, enjoyable to read markdown page.

Bonus points (if you have time)
Create a Stackoverflow account (if you don't have one). It's okay if asking / answering questions feels intimidation at first - don't feel pressured for this.

Start small: when using Stackoverflow in the future, upvote answers that helped you. This way, you reward the writers and these answers will be easier to find again at a later stage. It's also possible to star answers you need frequently.

Over time, you'll end up using more Stackoverflow features and get more confident to post your own questions / answers (if you want to).
